# Charity: water â€“ Water Drop Game Starter
In this game, users collect as many falling water drops as possible while avoiding pollutants (bad drops). Users tap to collect drops before they hit the ground. Include a score counter, feedback messages, and penalties for "bad drops" to make it more engaging.
